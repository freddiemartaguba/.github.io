    <p>Radio Frequency (RF)
    A signal frequency with greater than 300 MHz is considered RF.
    
    In modern cellular standard LTE, the low band roughly starts at 600 MHz and extends to 6000 MHz refer
    B46 is the last LTE band in frequency.
    
    Carrier Signal
    Its a high-frequency signal that “carries” the lower bandwidth of “real” information signals such voice and data
    
    The reason is that due to the miniaturization of consumer electronics, a high RF carrier signal is needed for efficient
    electromagnetic radiation using small antenna in transmission and reception of wireless networks.
    
    Baseband Signal
    Its a low bandwidth analog signal containing data such as voice and data typically found after downconverting from RF
    to DC before analog to digital converter (ADC) in radio receiver or right after digital to analog converter (DAC) in
    radio transmitter.
    
    Two main reasons for using a low BW baseband signal are:
    
    Come within sampling range of ADC/DAC: sampling rates are limited on ADC/DAC mixed-signal hardware which is needed for
    pre/post-digital signal processing.
    
    Improved selectivity: An easier filter design with sharper rolloff can be constructed at lower frequencies.
    
    Quadrature: Orthogonal relationship (i.e. 90 degrees) between two vectors.
    
    Quadrature I/Q Components: two components I (in-phase signal) and Q (out-of-phase signal) are 90 degrees out of phase.
    IQ signals are the building block of modern digital modulation and demodulation schemes.
    
    Modulation
    Modulation means encoding a message. In the context of RF, one can think of it in two ways:
    
    Encoding a baseband message on a carrier frequency signal.
    
    Frequency shifts the baseband signal to a radio frequency signal.
    
    Analog Modulation
    It is used to encode analog baseband signal onto an RF carrier signal for long-range transmission with low data
    bandwidth such as voice, and small data packets.
    
    Typical analog modulations are:
    
    Amplitude Modulation (AM): analog baseband signal is encoded on an RF carrier signal in the form of varying RF carrier
    signal amplitude.
    
    Frequency Modulation (FM): analog baseband signal is encoded on an RF carrier signal in the form of varying RF carrier
    signal frequency
    
    Digital Modulation.
    It is used to encode digital baseband signal (i.e. binary bits 0 and 1) onto an RF carrier signal for short to mid-range
    transmission with high data bandwidth such as large file download and video streaming.
    
    Typical digital modulations are:
    
    Amplitude Shift Keying: 1-bit binary signal modulation scheme where 1 and 0 are represented by turning on and off RF
    carrier transmission.
    
    Frequency Shift Keying: 1-bit binary signal modulation scheme where 1 and 0 are represented by changing RF carrier
    signal from high to low frequency.
    
    Phase Shift keying: 1-bit symbol binary signal modulation scheme where 1 and 0 are represented by change RF carrier
    signal phase relationship.
    
    Quadrature Amplitude modulation (QAM): a baseband signal is encoded by summing two carrier signals 90 degrees out of
    phase (i.e. I & Q components) resulting in a single signal that is controlled by phase and amplitude variation of two
    I/Q carriers.
    
    Digital symbols are reconstructed by a combination of amplitude and phase relationship of the I & Q components. This is
    very clever and powerful because by varying amplitude and phase relationships of I & Q carriers, a range of unique
    symbols can be created resulting in an increase of bits/symbol; Hence higher data throughput is achieved.
    
    This technique increases spectral efficiency (i.e. more bits/symbols transmitted per fixed channel bandwidth).
    
    Quadrature Phase shift Keying (QPSK): It’s a 2-bit modulation technique with 4 unique symbols, 00, 01, 10, and 11 are
    represented by phase change (45,135, 225, or 315 degrees) of the carrier signal using I and Q components in quadrature
    amplitude modulation (QAM).
    
    Note: QPSK is a special type of 4-QAM where the resultant signal has equal amplitude with varying phases.
    
    Analog/Digital Demodulation
    Demodulation is analogous to decoding an RF signal which involves removing carrier frequency component from the RF
    signal leaving the baseband signal behind for further processing.
    
    Basic Principles of Operations
    RF system is responsible for the transmission and reception of wireless signals.
    
    RF Transmission: An RF signal is created by upshifting a low bandwidth (DC-like) signal to radio frequency by a radio
    transmitter.
    
    RF reception: An RF signal is picked up by the antenna and downshifted to a low bandwidth (DC-like) signal by a radio
    receiver.</p>
